Clarity-Wordpress-Theme
=======================

Clarity is a super-simple Tumblr-like theme. It’s free but comes with plenty of cool features, like ‘loving’ posts through ZillaLikes and full post format support. It’s also responsive, which is always nice! Did I mention it’s retina-ready too?

### Installation
Upload the clarity folder (this folder) to your /wp-content/themes/ directory OR Upload through Appearance > Themes.

Need help? Post in Support Forums for Clarity, found through Clarity's page in the WP.ORG Themes Repo. I'll help you as much as I can.

Just a couple extra notes: This is meant to be a 'tumblr' like theme. As such, I've purposefully removed/hidden Pages. Links are also hidden. I would have liked to hide comments too but it's required for themes in the Wordpress repo.

Future Updates: In future versions I plan to add a few things. I would like to add an option to hide comments completely as I don't want them there. Instead, there'll be a 'Tweet At This Author' button of sorts. I'd like to add in better audio format support with a slim custom audio player. I'd like to style the 'loading more posts' part a little better. There's a few more things but I've forgotten them now. They'll come later though. Have an idea? Shoot me an email - bryce@captaintheme.com.

Made a translation? I love you. Shoot me an email - bryce@captaintheme.com and I'll include it + maybe give you a present.

Thank you!
